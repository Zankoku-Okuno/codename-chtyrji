It blew my mind that after four years of German as a kid, I only learned in adulthood that «z» is pronounced /t͜s/.

I heard someone speaking an unknown language on the train the other day.
It had ejectives and only occaisional long vowels.
It did seem to only have a few vowels, which might be accurate, or might have been vowel harmony.
I was thinking about getting long vowels through a compensatory lengthening process, but actually, why not a morphological one?
I would like a bunch of morphology to build words up out of (woah, look at that string of prepositions), and allowing vowels to come next to each other without epenthetic consonants.

Speaking of morphology, I was thinking about purely sound-based gender, but was bored of the PIE patterning on vowels.
Why not consonant-based gender more like in Japanese?
After all, I do like that inflectional system.

I believe the languages I was inspired by while working on Utsishcy[sp?] were: Aleut, Blackfoot, and the Marphali low glide.
Actually, it's all in my bookmarks: Inspiration Board 1

I really want aspiration to be more of a thing than voicing.
I've done voicing.


I face a big decision re. front rounded vowels


[The low glide may be posited in] Proto-Indo-European h2, if we may read in this manner the latest very attractive proposal by Reynolds, West, and Coleman [2000]
