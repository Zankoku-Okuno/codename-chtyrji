All verbs mark for definiteness, and this is an old feature.
The lang used to be topic-comment; the verb marked to distinguish topic from subject cases.
    This marking is kinda "let's keep the topic rolling" vs. "surprise, we're talking about something different now"
Thanks to the specific semantics of the topic/subject marking, there was a restriction that only definite nouns could be the subject.
Definiteness and topic/comment were independent morphologically.
Finally, motion verbs also took person markings showing the reference frame for the motion.

A politeness strategy develops in motion verb person markings, which leads to ergative person marking in motion verbs.
Definiteness and topic/subject marking fuse and topic/subject distinction becomes switch reference as the topic-comment tendency morphs into subject-verb.
At the same time, more quantifiers get grammaticalized for plurals.
