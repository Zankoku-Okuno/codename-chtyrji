CHANGES

I have to get affricates naturally from h.C and/or N.C; I don't think what I'm doing right now makes much sense, even though it does go through a gemminate phase first.
    I think the NC > CC > C͜F rule is too much synchonically, but perhaps it'd work as a morphophonological rule
    baN + ta = batsa, but the borrowing "fanta" is fine
    coda-nasals are always homorganic with the following vowel, so that'll never be a problem
    some morphemes might have a fossilized affricate anyway

perhaps ŋ can only appear in the onset word-initially

there's something up with how I'm pronouncing coda-h as fricative that leads me to think that the timings are interesting: perhaps a little breathiness on the vowel, or the fricative is preaspirated?

===


phonetic xcription is really handy considering /sjisji/ can now be spelled shizhi



I may be being a bit too prissy with avoiding mergers
though maybe that's fine in a smaller phoneme invetory; something at least to remember for larger inventories
though, it seems (though it might just be me) that very large inventories just don't do much in the way of allophony at all


I've decided against ejectives, as they feel tacked on.
same for the front rounded glide and vowel

When morphologically a syllable would start with a vowel, an epenthetic glide is inserted.

There must have been uvular consonants earlier that mostly merged with velars, or disappeared, or something.
The low glide stuck around and held adjacent consonants in place.


Cheyenne has h > s / e_t, which is very cool.
Any way I could get an s~h alternation?
Probly: codas are allowed to be homorganic nasal (N) or h.
The coda-h is a remanant of prior coda fricatives, and in some contexts a fricative re-asserts itself. Perhaps as s before t, and f before p. The coda-h would elide before nasals, and lengthen following fricatives.
historically k > x > h, so k is gone now; also explains why I've got voiced fricatives except /x/
potentially /x/ doesn't participate in intervocalic fricative voicing




It's not an interesting bit of phonetics if it's not affected by or conditioned by any phonological rules.
Or at least interesting enough to show up in a phonetic transcription.

Use the assymetries in the phonology to drive the distribution of phonemes in contexts and open up irregularities once morphophonologically-motivated irregularities.

if affixes affect the stress pattern, then it's not an agglutinating language (fusion can occur in suprasegmentals alone)

-------------------



mark the/a in the verb: verb agreement takes one of two forms based on whether the agreed-with noun is definite or indefinite
switch reference starts to look nice, maybe

if we're marking a bunch of prepositional cases, perhaps those are suffixional
    it occurs to me that trigadesleng does some cool things with verb+preposition that I should look at for inspiration
    heck, verbs of motion could have a different (probly also wider) set of grammaticalized prepositions, and those prepositions it shares with non-motion verbs might take on a different meaning
otherwise, I'd like to keep case marking slim: just relative and absolutive
    I might even repurpose them for possession marking, but if not, I think an independent case marking for possesion is good, and the order with the relative cases wouldn't matter
though, a quirky dative might be cool


these are isolated features that need to be integrated, especially think about what nouns do, since the more the verb takes on, likely the less the noun does
    limited noun incorporation might be good
        i.e. a small set of nouns that can be incorporated, usually very old nouns, that have metaphorized their semantics
        e.g. use fire with in/out prepositions to add semantics about preparation
        but why wouldn't this just look like derivational morphonology?
        nouns for body parts are good candidates
    evidentiality
        (here are just some things I use a lot in English) my guess is, someone's guess is, I/someone was told, I/someone remember (but am aware of the fickleness of human memory), seems/appears, it can probably be inferred, one piece of direct evidence, definitely (many direct evidences)
        and let these stack up so that "I heard that it seems to them that they_2 definitely know that"
    polypersonal agreement
        could take inspiration from Blackfoot's animacy restrictions
        something like, add agreement affixes starting from the most amimate object in the order subject-object
        I'd like to have something that means this will become voice
        WARNING: in any case, limiting polypoersonal agreement (or disallowing) should allow nouns to shine through some more

an infinitive with person agreement might have something to do with relative-clause-like constructions

if personal agreement was marked largely by coda fricatives (or even other lost elements before that), then it might have disappeared, causing a new set of pronouns to be used, and then grammaticalize; perhaps there's even some relics of the old personal agreement markers

the Lahu exampe in ch 8 of the zbb topic is interesting!

remember to think about negation and quantifier scope

I had never heard of specificity marking, so why not have nouns marked for it?
alliterative agreement, wat?


what about causitive-based derivations?:
    to eat + caus = to feed
    but what restrictions does that formation place on morphology?
    perhaps the stem is always inflected for past perfective, but then another tense marking is added after the causative marker
    two different causatives: one for states, and another for actions
    so, you could "cause someone to become full" or "cause someone to eat"


never settle for one-to-one
    have one phrase have multiple meanings
    multiple ways to say the same meaning
    one inflection, multiple uses
    multiple inflections for one meaning


-----

directions should be suitable for minecraft, though I'll use different terms to hide it
primarily use to/from spawn (city center) and to/from base (home), then cardinal directions
have "left/right in direction of travel", but with person affixes (so you can say your direction for people entering a plane, or our direction for facing the nose of the plane)
in fact, person affixes on all directions might be a good idea
for that matter, how about person affixes on verbs of motion/direction, but not on other verbs
    I guess historically, there would have been possesives as a derterminer before the head noun
if verbs of motion are getting roped into person marking, why?: probly there are/were some manner/gestural/positional affixes (and it'd be cool if they are/left behind suffixes)

fire > fira > firaga
but if firaga were actually in, wt'd be firaxa, and perhaps I'd want free variation x~ɣ


English "Alaska" would be /harahkʼa/ [haraːkʼa]
    assuming coda-h induces glottalization
    also assuming the epenthetic consonant would be h
    though, there might not be epenthetic consonant in loanwords, if that obligatory syllable-initial consonant rule is no longer productive
sjisji(shizhi): dad/da-da (informal)
tanği /taŋɰ̠i/ [taɴɰ̠ɪ]
/ŋwutaN/ ngwodan, /ŋɰ̠utaN/ ngyudan

counting system:
    dozenal
    rip off metric for large numbers (literally borrow the morphemes, b/c the lang actually did borrow them)
    actually doing science (decimal metric) might need a separate set of (presumably borrowed) numbers

Georgian example: xelebi ga-m-i-tsiv-d-a "My hands got cold"
    xejebi

"to meet" can be used for "welcome", and can be inflected for 1st.pl or 2nd.pl depending on whether the meeting is social or parasocial

maybe I should stop fighting it and have verb roots start with a vowel then add prefixes

/-ahtʰ-/ ("use" for consumables, transitive only (or with a dropped object?): i.e. eat, drink, light a candle/flare, shoot an arrow)

<more?> - pl - aspect - root - tense - <more> - definite.switchref(.person)


/jahtʰ-u/ jestu (I/you/he/she/it eats)
v-oras-ast-i-tsu, voràsastítsu (we're about to eat if you want to join)
mo?{ant}-jast-ax-u (I've eaten) mòjestáxu
jestítsu (I am eating)
jestóxwou [jɛsˈtʰɔːxʷo] (sgdef was eating)
jestàxitcharó (the other one was eating)
vorastutsu (sgdef will be eating)
jestwoùtcharó (the other is eating)

should the extra consonants vowels have a set rule, or should it be possible to use them all?
    jestwoúzu
    jestwourízu



that inclusive marker could get used for a cohortative (let's ...)


good evening: evening-meet(v.) + positive mirative
essentially, incorporate the time of day into theverb to meet
then conventionalize a particular inflectional form to mean that

------

when creating affixes (or non-concatenative morphology), be sure to have some be non-productive and therefore have more fossilized, metaphorical effects

a thing in nooblangs seems to be that the lang has so much flexibility it'll fall apart

It's a lot easier to make realistic inflection if you know how to make analytic languages; just grammaticalize.
